## Install dependencies and run the app
The run.sh script installs the necessary dependencies, including Node.js and npm.
To execute this script, you need to use sudo permissions (to install Node.js and npm).
The script will automatically run the app with your default browser.
Open a terminal in your project directory and enter the following command:
```sudo ./run.sh```

## Opening project after installation

After you already used run.sh script once, there is no need to run it again.
You can just use the following commands to open it:
```npm start```
```xdg-open http://localhost:5000/```
